# Python Calculator App

A simple command-line calculator built with Python to demonstrate foundational programming skills.

## Features
- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **User-Friendly**: Interactive menu-driven interface
- **Error Handling**: Prevents crashes from invalid inputs

## Why I Built This
- To practice core Python concepts (functions, loops, input/output)
- To document my self-study progress during gap years

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed
2. Clone this repository:

4. Excute the program:
   python calculator.py or just run calculator.py

   Structure:
   calculator.py
├── add(x, y)            # Returns sum of two numbers
├── subtract(x, y)       # Returns difference
├── multiply(x, y)       # Returns product
├── divide(x, y)         # Returns quotient
└── Main loop            # Handles user interaction
